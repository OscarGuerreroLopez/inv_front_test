# inventory test

Simple web app to play with the back end that I’ve done for this test. You can click on inventory to see the inventory in real time. If you delete a product, which you can do at the products page, the inventory will be updated when you go back to it.
I didn’t have much time to make it look nice, but at least it is responsive

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn`

Installs all the necessary packages

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
